## Note to Readers

Most of the CTF challenges in this repository will **start directly after the `wget` command**.  
We won’t be showing the step where the challenge files are downloaded — that part is assumed to be already done.

For context, **`wget`** is a command-line utility used to **download files from the web**.  
It supports **HTTP**, **HTTPS**, and **FTP** protocols, making it ideal for quickly downloading almost every forms of media in order to have a seamless experience without having to deal with problems on the source page itself.

Example:
```bash
wget https://exampleurl.com/challenge01.zip
```
Once you’ve downloaded the necessary files using wget, you can follow along from the next step in each challenge.

- The challenges themselves are available on the [picoCTF website](https://play.picoctf.org/practice) which can be accessed once you register on their website and are done exploring.
- Another important website that we will use for encryption of flags and other purposes will be [Cyber Chef](https://cyberchef.org/). Since this will be a non serious series of challenges on easy mode. We will use automated way of decryption for seamless action and longer hours of focus on the problems themselves.
