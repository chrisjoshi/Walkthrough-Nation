## Note to Readers

Most of the CTF challenges in this repository will **start directly after the `wget` command**.  
We won’t be showing the step where the challenge files are downloaded — that part is assumed to be already done.

For context, **`wget`** is a command-line utility used to **download files from the web**.  
It supports **HTTP**, **HTTPS**, and **FTP** protocols, making it ideal for quickly downloading almost every forms of media in order to have a seamless experience without having to deal with problems on the source page itself.

Example:
```bash
wget https://exampleurl.com/challenge01.zip
```

Once you’ve downloaded the necessary files using wget, you can follow along from the next step in each challenge.
